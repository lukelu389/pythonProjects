partition/making groups that is irrelevant of order, simple group making: disjoint set union/kruskal

frequency: prefix/suffix sum, dictionary

partition with specific order: tree(N nodes N-1 edges), graph

binary-lifting, fenwick/binary tree

dijkstra, dijkstra twice?, spfa/floyd warshall for negative edges

dfs and bfs + all of the above

floodfill

backtracking, dp, binary search

math, groups: what about: all possible - groups that are invalid = groups that are valid

input case very big > 1e9: dp, binary search
binary search: sorted input, maximizing the minimum might need

dp/recursion + memoization, top-down approach if the base cases are very simple, bottom-up approach if transition can be easily found
adhoc/constructive/implementation: edge cases, tracing, subtasks first
